A data scraper and visualization project for the New Jersey Division of Elections website.

The NJOIT Open Data Center serves many data sets produced at the expense of NJ tax payers. (https://data.nj.gov/) Curiously, it does not serve the data on the NJ Division of Elections - Election Results Archive. 

This code is built to crawl, compile and help citizens both analyze and visualize the voter data stored at https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/election-information-results.shtml.
